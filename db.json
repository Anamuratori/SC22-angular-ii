      "ingredients": "2 tbsp olive oil, \n knob butter, \n 1 onion, finely chopped, \n 500g sausagemeat or skinned sausages, \n grated zest of 1 lemon, \n 100g fresh white breadcrumbs, \n 85g ready-to-eat dried apricots, chopped, \n 50g chestnut, canned or vacuum-packed, chopped, \n 2 tsp chopped fresh or 1tsp dried thyme, \n 100g cranberries, fresh or frozen, \n 500g boneless, skinless chicken breasts, \n 500g pack ready-made shortcrust pastry, \n beaten egg, to glaze",
      "method": "Heat oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Heat 1 tbsp oil and the butter in a frying pan, then add the onion and fry for 5 mins until softened. Cool slightly. Tip the sausagemeat, lemon zest, breadcrumbs, apricots, chestnuts and thyme into a bowl. Add the onion and cranberries, and mix everything together with your hands, adding plenty of pepper and a little salt. \n Cut each chicken breast into three fillets lengthwise and season all over with salt and pepper. Heat the remaining oil in the frying pan, and fry the chicken fillets quickly until browned, about 6-8 mins. \n Roll out two-thirds of the pastry to line a 20-23cm springform or deep loose-based tart tin. Press in half the sausage mix and spread to level. Then add the chicken pieces in one layer and cover with the rest of the sausage. Press down lightly. \n Roll out the remaining pastry. Brush the edges of the pastry with beaten egg and cover with the pastry lid. Pinch the edges to seal, then trim. Brush the top of the pie with egg, then roll out the trimmings to make holly leaf shapes and berries. Decorate the pie and brush again with egg. \n Set the tin on a baking sheet and bake for 50-60 mins, then cool in the tin for 15 mins. Remove and leave to cool completely. Serve with a winter salad and pickles.",

      "author": "Mary Cadogan",
      "ingredients": "175g butter, chopped \n 200g dark muscovado sugar \n 750g luxury mixed dried fruit (one that includes mixed peel and glacé cherries) \n finely grated zest and juice of 1 orange \n finely grated zest of 1 lemon \n 100ml/3½ fl oz cherry brandy or brandy plus 4tbsp more \n 85g macadamia nut \n 3 large eggs, lightly beaten \n 85g ground almond \n 200g plain flour \n ½ tsp baking powder \n 1 tsp ground mixed spice \n 1 tsp ground cinnamon \n ¼ tsp ground allspice",
      "method": "Put the butter, sugar, fruit, zests, juice and 100ml/3½fl oz brandy in a large pan. Bring slowly to the boil, stirring until the butter has melted. Reduce the heat and bubble for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. \n Remove the pan from the heat and leave to cool for 30 minutes. \n Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 150C/gas 2/ fan 130C and line a 20cm round cake tin. Toast the nuts in a dry frying pan, tossing them until evenly browned, or in the oven for 8-10 minutes - keep an eye on them as they burn easily. When they are cool, chop roughly. Stir the eggs, nuts and ground almonds into the fruit mixture and mix well. Sift the flour, baking powder and spices into the pan. Stir in gently, until there are no traces of flour left. \n Spoon the mixture into the tin and smooth it down evenly - you will find this is easiest with the back of a metal spoon which has been dipped into boiling water. \n Bake for 45 minutes, then turn down the heat to 140C/gas 1/ fan120C and cook for a further 1-1¼ hours (about a further 1¾ hours if you have a gas oven) until the cake is dark golden in appearance and firm to the touch. Cover the top of the cake with foil if it starts to darken too much. To check the cake is done, insert a fine skewer into the centre - if it comes out clean, the cake is cooked. \n Make holes all over the warm cake with a fine skewer and spoon the extra 4tbsp brandy over the holes until it has all soaked in. Leave the cake to cool in the tin. When it's cold, remove it from the tin, peel off the lining paper, then wrap first in baking parchment and then in foil. The cake will keep in a cupboard for up to three months or you can freeze it for six months."

      "ingredients": "200g dark muscovado sugar \n 175g butter, chopped \n 700g luxury mixed dried fruit \n 50g glacé cherries \n 2 tsp grated fresh root ginger \n zest and juice 1 orange \n 100ml dark rum, brandy or orange juice \n 85g/3oz pecannuts, roughly chopped \n 3 large eggs, beaten \n 85g ground almond \n 200g plain flour \n ½ tsp baking powder \n 1 tsp mixed spice \n 1 tsp cinnamon \n 400g pack ready-rolled marzipan(we used Dr Oetker) \n 4 tbsp warm apricotjam or shredless marmalade \n 500g pack fondant icingsugar \n icing sugar, for dusting \n 6 gold and 6 silver muffincases \n 6 gold and 6 silver sugared almonds \n snowflake sprinkles",
      "method": "Tip the sugar, butter, dried fruit, whole cherries, ginger, orange zest and juice into a large pan. Pour over the rum, brandy or juice, then put on the heat and slowly bring to the boil, stirring frequently to melt the butter. Reduce the heat and bubble gently, uncovered for 10 mins, stirring every now and again to make sure the mixture doesn’t catch on the bottom of the pan. Set aside for 30 mins to cool. \n Stir the nuts, eggs and ground almonds into the fruit, then sift in the flour, baking powder and spices. Stir everything together gently but thoroughly. Your batter is ready. \n Heat oven to 150C/130C fan/gas 2. Scoop the cake mix into 12 deep muffin cases (an ice-cream scoop works well), then level tops with a spoon dipped in hot water. Bake for 35-45 mins until golden and just firm to touch. A skewer inserted should come out clean. Cool on a wire rack. \n Unravel the marzipan onto a work surface lightly dusted with icing sugar. Stamp out 12 rounds, 6cm across. Brush the cake tops with apricot jam, top with a marzipan round and press down lightly. \n Make up the fondant icing to a spreading consistency, then swirl on top of each cupcake. Decorate with sugared almonds and snowflakes, then leave to set. Will keep in a tin for 3 weeks."

      "ingredients": "500g strong white flour, plus extra for dusting \n 7g sachet fast-action dried yeast \n 300ml milk \n 40g unsalted butter, softened at room temperature \n 1 egg \n vegetable oil, for greasing \n 25g unsalted butter, melted \n 75g soft brown sugar \n 2 tsp ground cinnamon \n 100g dried cranberries \n 100g chopped dried apricot \n 50g caster sugar \n zest 1 lemon \n 200g icing sugar",
      "method": "Put the flour and 1 tsp salt into a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the yeast. Meanwhile, warm the milk and butter in a pan until the butter melts and the mixture is lukewarm. Add the milk mixture and egg to the flour mixture and stir until the contents come together as a soft dough (add extra flour if you need to). \n Tip the dough onto a well-floured surface. Knead for 5 mins, adding more flour if necessary, until the dough is smooth, elastic and no longer sticky. \n Lightly oil a bowl with the vegetable oil. Place the dough in the bowl and turn until covered in oil. Cover the bowl with cling film and set aside in a warm place for 1 hr or until doubled in size. Lightly grease a baking sheet and set aside. \n For the filling, knock the dough back to its original size and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll it into a 1cm-thick rectangle. Brush all over with the melted butter, then sprinkle over the sugar, cinnamon and fruit. \n Roll up the dough into a tight cylinder, cut into 9 x 4cm slices and position on the prepared baking sheet, leaving a little space between. Cover with a tea towel and set aside to rise for 30 mins. \n Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Bake the buns for 20-25 mins or until risen and golden brown. Meanwhile, melt the glaze sugar with 4 tbsp water until syrupy. \n Remove from oven and glaze. Set aside to cool on a wire rack. Once cool, mix the zest and icing sugar with about 2 tbsp water to drizzle over the buns. Serve."

      "method": "Heat oven to 190C/170 fan/gas 5 and line a 12-hole muffin tin with cake cases. Put all the cake ingredients into a bowl and mix with a whisk until smooth. Spoon the mix into the cases, bake for 25 mins until golden and risen and a skewer comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack. \n For the frosting, beat the butter, vanilla extract and icing sugar until pale and creamy and completely combined. To make snowmen, reindeer and Christmas puddings, first spread the icing over the top of each cake. Then lay the chocolate buttons on top, slicing some buttons into quarters to make ears and hats. Finally, use icing pens for the details. For the Christmas tree, colour the icing with green food colouring and pipe onto the cakes using a star-shaped nozzle, decorate with sweets, sprinkles and white chocolate stars."
